## Google Store Transaction Revenue Prediction

In this project, we deal with transaction revenues data provided by
Google Store. First, we clean the dataset so that we can use it more
accurately. And before we dive into the model building part, we briefly
explore the dataset using visualization tools. And lastly, we build two
machine learning models, XGBoost and LightGBM, to predict how much a
visitor will spend.
