Google Store Transaction Revenue Prediction
================

> Exploring Google Store data set and building models to predict
> transaction revenues

### Introduction

Google Store is an online retailer operated by Google that sells
hardware and accessories. In this project, we deal with transaction
revenues data provided by Google Store. First, we clean the dataset so
that we can use it more accurately. And before we dive into the model
building part, we briefly explore the dataset using visualization tools.
And lastly, we build two machine learning models, XGBoost and LightGBM,
to predict how much a visitor will spend.

This is how Google Store looks like:

### Installation

  - You can download the dataset used in this project
    [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/data).
  - Please note that we use the previous version of dataset (not the
    files named train\_v2.csv and test\_v2.csv).
  - This project builds a LightGBM model so your computer needs to have
    the “lightgbm” library. Please refer to this [installation
    guide](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation-Guide.html)
    to install the library on your computer.
